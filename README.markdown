> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> When I started producing ARM64 builds for Deno I didn't expect to be maintaining it for over 3 years â€“ but now this project has officially come to an end.
> 
> - You can find official binary releases for ARM64 over at [`denoland/deno` releases](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases)
> - The official [`denoland/deno`](https://hub.docker.com/r/denoland/deno) image on docker.io now supports `linux/arm64` and `linux/amd64` platforms. You should be able to straightforwardly replace `lukechannings/deno` with `denoland/deno`.
