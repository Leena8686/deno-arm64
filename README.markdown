# Deno for ARM64

[![Docker Image Version (tag latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/lukechannings/deno/latest?label=Docker%20Image)](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lukechannings/deno)
[![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/lukechannings/deno-arm64?label=ARM64%20Binary)](https://github.com/LukeChannings/deno-arm64/releases)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is deprecated because [Deno is now providing ARM64 builds](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/22298).
> As of v1.40.4 `deno upgrade` will pull the latest binary from the official Deno repository. I won't be providing releases past v1.40.4.
>
> I'll continue to produce multi-architecture container images until the Docker project starts to provide them. [You can follow that issue here.](https://github.com/denoland/deno_docker/issues/337)
